## Background

This project contains a simple setup wherein data pushed to Tableland Basin (replicated to Filecoin) is fetched remotely and queried with [polars](https://www.pola.rs/).

### Data

The script fetches data from the `wxm2` namespace on a cron schedule. For every run, it will query data and write the results to:

- [Data](./Data.md): Summary metrics for the run, including averages across all columns.
- [History](./history.csv): A CSV file containing the full history of all runs, along with the run date and time.

The schema for the data is as follows for the averages:

- `device_id` (varchar), `timestamp` (bigint), `temperature` (double), `humidity` (double), `precipitation_accumulated` (double), `wind_speed` (double), `wind_gust` (double), `wind_direction` (double), `illuminance` (double), `solar_irradiance` (double), `fo_uv` (double), `uv_index` (double), `precipitation_rate` (double), `pressure` (double), `model` (varchar)

And there are three additional columns for aggregates:

- `total_precipitation` (float), `num_devices` (int), `num_models` (int)

## Install

To set things up on your machine, you'll need to do the following:

1. Set up the virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
2. Upgrade pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Source the `env` to use it: `source env/bin/activate`

Then, you can use the Makefile command to install dependencies: `make install`

Alternatively, you can do all of these in one step (for local development) with: `make setup`

## Usage

Running `src/main.py` will fetch remote files from Tableland [Basin](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/basin-cli), load them into a `polars` dataframe, and then run queries on the data.

To use default time ranges (the full dataset), run:

```sh
make run
```

Or, you can define a custom time range with `start` and `end` arguments (in milliseconds), which will be used to filter the data when _queries_ are executed.

```sh
make run start=1697328000000 end=1697932798895
```

This does not impact how Basin deals/data is fetched; _all_ publications and deals will be retrieved. Note: the timestamp range for the wxm data namespace is for Oct 15-21: `1697328000000` to `1697932798895`

### Makefile Reference

The following defines all commands available in the Makefile:

- `make install`: Install dependencies with `pip`.
- `make run`: Run the `main.py` program to fetch Basin/wxm data, run queries, and write to metric summary files.
- `make setup`: Create a virtual environment, upgrade pip, and source your `env` (only for local development).
- `make freeze`: Freeze dependencies (only needed if you make changes to the deps during local development).
